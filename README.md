# Shrink bot

The assignment was to create a working chatbot from HTML and CSS starter pack that we where provided with. We should include conditionals and basic functions. 

## The problem

This was a pair programming project and our first real attempt on Javascript. We approached the problem by asking for help a lot in StackOverflow. During the process we learned to use the Chrome DevTools to identify where the faulty code was. We had some difficulties to find time for working together due to busy partners and sick kids. But we tried to squeeze in sessions where we could. If  we had had more time we would put more emphasis on planning the project and on prestudies in Javascript.
